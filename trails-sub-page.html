        <h2>Rexburg Rocks</h2>
        <img class="card-img" src="images/Trails 1.jpg" alt="Trails 1" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
        <p>Near the city of Rexburg, we have a classic trail known to the locals as Rexburg Rocks. It is filled
            with many different types of obstacles that will require you to add an extra sense of adventure 
            while out and about. It is located west of Rexburg and can be found near what many call 'R' Mountain.
            You will be required to have tow points on both the front and back of your rig, as a chance to bottom
            out is likely. Take a friend and have fun.
        </p>

        <h2>Hells Half Acre</h2>
        <img class="card-img" src="images/Hells Half Acre.JPG" alt="Trails 2" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
        <p> West of Shelly, ID what is most likely the hardest trail you will find, is the great Hells Half Acre run.
            Here you must take cation as Hell is in the name. Tow points, tires 35" and bigger are needed. Lockers arent
            neccesary but are helpful. There are two known loops and in both loops many bipasses for the harder parts.
            If you have trouble with being on 3 wheels or even steep obstacles, this will be a challenge to you. Be sure
            to have armor as you will need it. Take a friend and have fun.

        <h2>June Creek</h2>
        <img class="card-img" src="images/June Creek.jpg" alt="Trails 2" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
        <p>As you travel east of Idaho Falls, towards Bone, ID you will find a very scenic drive knows as June creek.
            June creek is more of a scenic run if you go more towards the end of the summer. At the beginning closer to
            spring, it may not be as scenic, but filled with mud and mud holes. Not much is required during the better parts
            of the year, but in the rainy parts you will need to have tow points and someone good to run with. Closer to the 
            top of the trail there is a very big snow drift year round. Have fun and try not to break anything.
